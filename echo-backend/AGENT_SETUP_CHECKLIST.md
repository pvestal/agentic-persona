- [ ] Implement event listeners in agents
- [ ] Add event prioritization
- [ ] Create event history tracking

### 2.2 Context Awareness
- [ ] Build rich context objects:
  ```python
  context = {
      "user_state": "active|idle|away",
      "conversation_history": [],
      "user_preferences": {},
      "time_context": {},
      "platform_state": {},
      "environmental_factors": {}
  }
  ```

- [ ] Add context persistence
- [ ] Create context prediction

### 2.3 Proactive Behaviors
- [ ] **Time-based triggers**:
  - Daily summaries
  - Reminder generation
  - Follow-up messages
- [ ] **Event-based triggers**:
  - Important email detection
  - Meeting preparation
  - Deadline warnings
- [ ] **Pattern-based triggers**:
  - Routine disruption alerts
  - Opportunity identification
  - Anomaly detection

## Phase 3: LLM Integration ðŸ”„

### 3.1 Model Selection
- [ ] Choose LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local)

## Implementation Priority Order:

1. **LLM Integration** (Enables actual intelligent responses)
2. **Event System Enhancement** (Makes agents reactive)
3. **Context Awareness** (Improves response quality)
4. **Platform Integrations** (Connects to real messages)
5. **Learning System** (Continuous improvement)
6. **Advanced Features** (Enhanced capabilities)

## Quick Start Actions:

1. Set up environment variables for LLM API keys
2. Implement the first reactive behavior: time-based daily summary
3. Create WebSocket event for real-time message updates
4. Add context tracking to autonomous responder
5. Build simple feedback UI component

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Unit tests for each reactive behavior
- [ ] Integration tests for agent coordination
- [ ] Load tests for real-time features
- [ ] Security tests for platform integrations
- [ ] User acceptance tests for autonomy levels
