## THIS SOFTWARE USES EXPENSIVE PAID APIS

### DO NOT RUN THIS SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE COSTS

## Estimated Monthly Costs

- Light automation

### Moderate Usage (Active Professional)  
- **4-6 hours/day**: $150-300/month
- 50-100 emails processed daily
- 200+ messages across platforms
- Active learning and evolution

### Heavy Usage (24/7 Automation)

- Continuous learning
- Multiple platform monitoring

## Cost Breakdown

### API Costs (Per Use)
| Service | Cost | Example Usage |
|---------|------|---------------|
| GPT-4 | $0.03/1K tokens | ~$0.10-0.30 per email |
| Claude 3 | $0.025/1K tokens | ~$0.08-0.25 per email |
| Twilio SMS | $0.0075/message | $7.50 per 1000 texts |
| Firebase Reads | $0.06/100K | Scales with activity |
| Firebase Writes | $0.18/100K | Every message saved |

### Hidden Costs
1. **Self-Improvement Loop**: AI uses API calls to improve = recursive costs
2. **Evolution Cycles**: Each evolution analyzes history = bulk token usage  
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Learning from your data costs money
4. **Retries**: Failed API calls still cost money

## BEFORE YOU RUN THIS:

### 1. Set Hard Limits
```bash
export MAX_DAILY_COST="10.00"
export MAX_MONTHLY_COST="100.00"
export EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN_COST="500.00"
```

### 2. Use Development Mode
```bash
export LLM_MODE="mock"  # No real API calls
export PROCESS_LIMIT="10"  # Max 10 messages/day
```

### 3. Monitor Usage
- Check Firebase Console daily
- Monitor API provider dashboards
- Set up billing alerts

### 4. Free Alternatives

Instead of this system, consider:
- **Ollama**: 100% local, 100% free
- **LocalAI**: Self-hosted, no API costs
- **PrivateGPT**: Offline operation
- **LangChain + Llama**: Build your own

## Financial Safety Rules

1. **NEVER** share this deployed system
2. **NEVER** let others use your instance  
3. **ALWAYS** use your own API keys
4. **ALWAYS** set spending limits
5. **MONITOR** costs daily

## Kill Switches

### Emergency Shutdown
```bash
# If costs spike, run immediately:
cd /workspaces/agentic-persona
python emergency_shutdown.py
```

### Disable All Processing
```bash
export DISABLE_ALL_AI="true"
export MOCK_MODE="true"
```

## YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

By proceeding, you accept full financial responsibility for ALL costs incurred.
