```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **User-First Philosophy**
   - Every action is visible and controllable
   - Keyboard shortcuts for power users
   - Dense information display
   - Real-time feedback

2. **Multi-Provider AI**
   - Anthropic as primary (better nuance)
   - OpenAI as fallback
   - Mode selection: fast/smart/balanced

3. **Autonomy Levels**
   - 0: Off
   - 1: Notify only
   - 2: Draft responses
   - 3: Auto-respond (important only)
   - 4: Full automation

4. **Self-Improvement**
   - Client tracks performance metrics
   - Learns from interactions
   - Submits to evolution system
   - Applies optimizations dynamically

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Session Continuity** (Current)
   - Implement persistent session logging
   - State recovery system
   - Progress tracking

2. **Message Queue**
   - Reliable processing pipeline
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Priority handling

3. **Notification System**
   - Desktop notifications
   - Sound alerts
   - Badge counts

### Environment Status

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Vite (ready)
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLite (ready)
- **Deployment**: Firebase configured
- **Integrations**: Gmail, Telegram, SMS ready
- **LLM**: Multi-provider configured

### Session Notes

- Focus is on YOUR needs as primary user
- Maximum control and visibility prioritized
- Power user features emphasized
- Real-time feedback and status critical

### Resume Points

To continue next session:
1. Read this log
2. Check TODOS.md for current tasks
3. Review ControlCenter.vue for UI state
4. Test LLM integration with real keys
5. Continue with message queue implementation

### Critical Update: Cost Protection Added

**License Changed**: From MIT to Personal Use Only
**Repository**: Should be made PRIVATE on GitHub
**Cost Warnings**: Added throughout
**Emergency Shutdown**: `python emergency_shutdown.py`
**Cost Guardian**: Monitors and blocks expensive API calls

### Financial Safety Measures
1. Hard spending limits via environment variables
2. Cost tracking in `costs/usage_tracking.json`
3. Emergency shutdown if costs exceed limits
4. Warnings in README, LICENSE, and new COST_WARNING.md

### Next Session Priority
1. Implement local LLM options (Ollama integration)
2. Add mock mode for development
3. Create cost dashboard in UI
4. Test all kill switches
